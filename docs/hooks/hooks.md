# What is a Hook?

Hooks in ascii-ui.nvim are special functions that let you manage state and side
effects in your UI components. Inspired by the React hooks pattern, they allow
you to encapsulate stateful logic and reusable behaviors in a functional way,
making it easier to build dynamic and interactive UIs.

Hooks can only be used inside functional components or other hooksâ€”never in
regular functions or outside the component lifecycle.
