# What is a Neovim App?

Imagine a new kind of application that lives inside
Neovim — not just a plugin that adds a feature here
and there, but a fully-formed experience. A Neovim App
is exactly that: a self-contained, interactive application
that runs within your Neovim editor.

Unlike traditional plugins, a Neovim App is designed to
feel like its own world. You can launch it from the
command line, from a plugin, or as part of your workflow — and
it renders its UI using ASCII characters, creating an
immersive interface right in your terminal.

In short: a Neovim App isn’t just extending Neovim — it’s building on top of it.
It’s a new way to think about what’s possible inside your editor.
